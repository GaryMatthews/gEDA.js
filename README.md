SchematicsDesigner
=======================

SchematicsDesigner is a browser-based software to draw electrical schematics.
It's available under the terms and conditions of the GNU Affero GPL v3.

You design your elements as SVG e.g. in Inkscape, or use pixel formats like PNG or JPG.
Then you start SchematicsDesigner, drag and drop your elements on the canvas,
arrange them, connect them and when you're done, export your schematic in SVG format.

Includes tools to import elements from QElectroTech.
