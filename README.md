This project aims to create a -based application to draw electrical circuit schematics and PCB layouts
using the advantages of browser click, drap'n'drop, SVG, HTML5 and jQuery features.

All web software is available under the terms and conditions of the GNU Affero GPL v3.
All other code and content, which is created in this project, is likewise available
under the terms and conditions of the GNU GPL v3 or the Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike v3.

Elements are designed as SVG e.g. in Inkscape, or using pixel formats like PNG or JPG.
You can drag'n'drop elements on the canvas, arrange them,
inter-connect them and export your schematic in SVG format.

Prototype is the C/C++ based gEDA project. Also the gEDA/gaf (*.sch, *.sym) file formats shall be supported.
Includes tools to import elements from QElectroTech.
Tools to auto-layout and prepare proto-board milling shall be developed.
